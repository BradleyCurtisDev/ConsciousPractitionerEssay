### Zenless Zone Zero as a Culturally Odorless Product

In the globalized digital market, the success of a media franchise often depends on its ability to transcend national borders. Koichi Iwabuchi (2002) introduced the concept of "culturally odorless" products—goods that are stripped of the racial, ethnic, or cultural markers of their country of origin to appeal to a wider international audience (Glasspool, 2013). While Iwabuchi originally applied this to Japanese exports like the Sony Walkman, the theory is strikingly relevant to the modern Chinese gaming giant HoYoverse and its latest title, Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ). To a significant extent, ZZZ exemplifies the "culturally odorless" product, utilizing a "stateless" anime aesthetic to mask its Chinese origins while curating a globally palatable urban identity.

Iwabuchi argues that odorless products do not conjure images of the producing nation in the consumer's mind. Zenless Zone Zero achieves this through a deliberate aesthetic of "urban fantasy" that defies geographical categorization. The game’s central hub, New Eridu, is a reference to global street culture rather than a representation of Shanghai or Beijing (Nelva, 2023). Its visual language borrows heavily from 1990s analog retro-futurism—CRT monitors, VHS tapes, and graffiti—which triggers a sense of shared millennial nostalgia common in the West and Japan, rather than a specific Chinese cultural memory (Zenless Zone Zero, 2025). As noted by game critics, the environment evokes the Shibuya-esque vibes of The World Ends with You or the Westernized cool of Jet Set Radio, effectively displacing the consumer’s focus from the developer’s nationality to a generalized "global cool." (Zenless Zone Zero Producer Reveals Surprising Inspirations (and It’s Not Persona 5) - IGN, s.d.)

Furthermore, ZZZ relies on the "anime-esque" art style to act as a cultural buffer. Despite being developed by a Chinese studio (HoYoverse), the game utilizes the visual grammar of Japanese animation (big eyes, exaggerated expressions, specific tropes like the "maid faction") (The Aesthetics of the Pull: Anime Style and Fan Culture in Zenless Zone Zero : A Study of Otaku Tropes, Database Consumption, and Cultural Proximity in a Gacha Game Reception, s.d.). In this context, the product is not just odorless; it effectively wears a "mask" of another culture. For the average player, the game "smells" of Akihabara, not mainland China. This aligns with Iwabuchi’s observation that cultural products often undergo a process of "de-ethnicization" to ensure friction-free consumption in global markets. The game’s UI, English voice acting, and hip-hop-influenced soundtrack further dilute any distinct "Chinese" cultural odor, allowing it to penetrate Western markets that might otherwise be resistant to explicitly foreign media.

However, the "odorlessness" is not absolute. As the game expands, HoYoverse re-introduces "fragrance" selectively through specific factions. For example, recent updates have teased characters with Wuxia (Chinese martial arts) aesthetics or Slavic industrial themes (ZarkySpin, 2025). Yet, these are presented as consumable "flavors" within the database of the game, rather than the defining identity of the text itself.

In conclusion, Zenless Zone Zero is a quintessential "culturally odorless" product in the sense that it successfully erases the "image of the country of origin" (China). By adopting a transcultural "anime" standard and a stateless urban setting, it creates a friction-free entry point for global consumers. It proves that in the modern game industry, the most successful global texts are those that belong to everywhere and nowhere at once.
